/** \page search The search routines
 *
 * An overview of the local and remote search routines in p4est.
 *
 * ## The basic idea
 *
 * During mesh-based simulations it may be desired to match multiple
 * user-defined queries with leaves of the forest. Next to a volume iteration
 * over all leaves using \ref p4est_iterate, p4est also offers several functions
 * for depth-first, top-down tree traversal of multiple query points at once in
 * \ref p4est_search.h (2D) and \ref p8est_search.h (3D), which allow to
 * efficiently prune large regions from the search early on.
 * \ref p4est_search_local (resp. \ref p8est_search_local in 3D) searches a set
 * of user-defined query points in the local part of the forest.
 * \ref p4est_search_partition (not mentioning the 3D equivalents from here
 * on for brevity) searches query points in the forest's partition and
 * assigns them to intersecting processes.
 * It can be used to organize a parallel search of distributed sets of queries
 * unrelated to the partition of the mesh elements.
 *
 * This feature is immensely powerful when a distributed point cloud, or the
 * contents of a massive parallel input file, are to be matched efficiently
 * with the elements of a parallel mesh.
 * This functionality can be used to send the points to their matching
 * processes in a decentralized point-to-point, scalable manner.
 * Please see [the associated paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3401990)
 * for details.
 *
 * ## Search objects
 *
 * We abstract the search functionality by intersecting points with
 * quadrants.  The quadrant is an inner node or a leaf of the refinement
 * tree, and a point can be anything:  an actual point in space, a search
 * region, a geometric object, or any other concept that may intersect a
 * quadrant.
 * The user passes an array of points, formulated as anonymous pointers, to
 * the toplevel search routines, which make them available to user-defined
 * callback functions (cf. \ref p4est_search_local_t).
 *
 * A single point may match with multiple quadrants (in fact it must
 * when considering the ancestors of a leaf quadrant that it resides in).
 * A point may have non-zero volume, extent or shape which overlaps more
 * than one, and even a large number, of mesh quadrants.
 *
 * It is up to the user to define the point-quadrant intersection function.
 * The p4est library does not perform any interpretation and does not
 * require any explicit information about a point.
 *
 * ## Local search
 *
 * To search the local part of the forest, \ref p4est_search_local can be
 * called on an array of user-defined query points.  Additionally, it
 * receives user-defined quadrant and point callbacks of type \ref
 * p4est_search_local_t.
 *
 * The search traverses all local quadrants by proceeding recursively top-down.
 * For each tree, it may start at the root of that tree, or further down at the
 * root of the subtree that contains all of the tree's local quadrants.
 * The quadrant callback is executed whenever a quadrant is entered and once
 * when it is left. If the callback returns false, the current quadrant and its
 * descendants are excluded from further recursion.
 * If the quadrant callback returns true, the point callback is executed for
 * every potentially matching point and shall return true for any matching
 * point. If it returns false, the point is discarded for the current branch.
 * The set of points that potentially match a given quadrant diminishes from
 * the root down to the leaves. If no points remain, the recursion stops.
 * The point callback is allowed to return true for the same point and more than
 * one quadrant; in this case more than one matching quadrants may be identified.
 * The callback may use an efficient, over-inclusive test for ancestor quadrants,
 * see, for example, \ref spheres/spheres2.c.
 * Only on leaves it must return exact results.
 *
 * There are several variants of the local search, which allow to customize it
 * to one's needs, e.g. by reordering or subsetting the child quadrants before
 * entering the recursion using \ref p4est_search_reorder.
 *
 * ## Partition search
 *
 * To search points in the global partition of a parallel distributed forest,
 * \ref p4est_search_partition can be called on an array of user-defined
 * query points. Similar to the local search, it receives user-defined
 * quadrant and point callbacks of type \ref p4est_search_partition_t.
 *
 * The search traverses the global partition top-down, for multiple points
 * at once if so desired, calling the quadrant and point callbacks on a
 * quadrant as described for the local search.
 * The recursion only goes down branches that are split between multiple
 * processors.
 * The partition search operates completely without communication. It can be
 * used to map parallel distributed sets of query points to the processes
 * whose local mesh they intersect. Based on the actions performed in the
 * intersection callback, the user may proceed for example to
 * communicate with the matching process for any point.
 * The reciever of a point can then continue with a local search to identify
 * one (or more) mesh elements that the point intersects.
 * An example of this parallel search workflow using non-blocking
 * point-to-point communication on the user side can be found in
 * \ref spheres/spheres2.c.
 *
 * If the forest to be searched is not available locally at all, e.g. because
 * it resides on an entirely different communicator, the partition search can be
 * performed on an array of global first positions, which encodes the partition
 * boundaries, by calling the variant \ref p4est_search_partition_gfp.
 *
 * ## Examples using the search
 *
 * There are several examples in 2D and 3D using the search.
 *
 * The examples \ref search/search_replicated2.c and
 * \ref search/search_replicated3.c test the local search and the partition
 * search routine for consistency.
 * First, a set of random points is generated and replicated on all processes.
 * While this approach is not scalable, it allows to compare the results from
 * searching the points locally on each process with the results of a partition
 * search of the same set of queries.
 *
 * The examples \ref particles/particles2.c and \ref particles/particles3.c
 * use the partition and local search routine in a scalable particle
 * tracking simulation. Here, the query points are proper points, which move
 * through the domain and across process boundaries in an ever-adapting mesh.
 *
 * The examples \ref spheres/spheres2.c and \ref spheres/spheres3.c show how the
 * search routines can be applied to queries with positive volumes; in this
 * case, spheres. Here, a sphere matches any quadrant that intersects its
 * surface.

 /** \example spheres/spheres2.c
 *
 * This 2D example program (3D counterpart: \ref spheres/spheres3.c) randomly
 * generates parallel distributed sets of 2D sphere shells (annuli) and refines
 * all quadrants of a 2D forest intersecting any of the cells.
 *
 * The sphere shells are entered as query objects into a partition search, which
 * assigns them to all their intersecting processes. Subsequently, the processes
 * are informed about incoming messages using a notify algorithm. Then the
 * spheres' definitions are sent using non-blocking point-to-point communication.
 * The receiving processes enter the sphere shells into a local search.
 * When any sphere intersects a leaf quadrant, the quadrant is marked for
 * refinement. The refined forest gets repartitioned before entering the next
 * iteration of adaptive refinement.
 * During the searches there are two tests to decide if a sphere shell
 * intersects a quadrant. On the leaf level an exact test is performed. On
 * shallower levels an approximate test compares the distance of the sphere
 * center and the quadrant center with their radii to determine if an
 * intersection is theoretically possible.

*
* The forest is a 2x2 brick covering the unit square. First, it is refined

*
* The adaptive refinement of the forest can be controlled by its maxlevel and

* small enough, a uniform p4est can be enforced.
* Similarly, the query point creation can be controlled by the

* Setting c to 0 leads to a uniform distribution. Higher values of c lead to
